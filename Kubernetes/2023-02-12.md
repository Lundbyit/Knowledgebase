## Plan your network AKS

# Internal load balancer
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/internal-lb
Do we need to specify where the loadbalancer should be deployed if the nodes are on different subnets but same VNET?
Use this to specify private link? - https://cloud-provider-azure.sigs.k8s.io/topics/pls-integration/ 
The AKS resource group might need Network Contributor role for this.

# Images
Consider importing public images to your own container registry. It gives you more control of your images

# Compute for your cluster
Consider less compute for your system node to save money

## System nodes
This reference implementation deploys the system node pool with three DS2_v2 nodes. That size is sufficient to meet the expected load of the system pods. The OS disk is 512 GB.

## Agent nodes
we've chosen DS4_v2 for the production workload. To lower costs one could drop the size to DS3_v2, which is the minimum recommendation.
When planning capacity for your cluster, assume that your workload can consume up to 80% of each node; the remaining 20% is reserved for AKS services.

Set the maximum pods per node based on your capacity planning. If you are trying to establish a capacity baseline, start with a value of 30. Adjust that value based on the requirements of the workload, the node size, and your IP constraints.

Think inside-out - What should the cluster access be able to access, ACR, KV etc
outside-in - What should access the cluster, FrontDoor?
